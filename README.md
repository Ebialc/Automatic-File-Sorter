Organize Downloads Folder
Overview

This Python script helps organize your downloads folder by categorizing files into smaller folders based on their file types.
Usage
1. Replace the downloads folder path

Replace 'D:\Downloads' with the actual path to your downloads folder in the script.
2. Run the script

Run the script using Python (e.g., python organize_downloads.py).
3. Let the script do its magic

The script will create folders for each category and move files into their respective folders based on their file types.
Categories

The script organizes files into the following categories:

    images: jpg, jpeg, png, gif, bmp
    videos: mp4, avi, mov, wmv
    executables: exe
    documents: docx, doc, pdf, txt, epub, pptx, ppt, xlsx
    audio: mp3, wav, ogg
    archives: zip, rar, 7z, tar, pkg
    others: catch-all for unknown file types

Notes

    This script assumes that the file type can be determined by the file extension. If you have files with incorrect or missing extensions, they may not be organized correctly.
    This script does not handle subfolders within the downloads folder. If you need more advanced features, please let me know and I can help you modify the script.

Customization

If you need to add or modify categories, you can do so by editing the categories dictionary in the script. For example, you can add a new category for iso files by adding the following line:

python

categories['iso_files'] = ['iso']

Scheduling the Script

To run the script every 24 hours, you can use a scheduler like cron on Linux/macOS or the Task Scheduler on Windows.
Linux/macOS (using cron)

    Open the terminal and type crontab -e to edit the cron table.
    Add the following line to schedule the script to run every 24 hours:

0 0 * * * python /path/to/organize_downloads.py

Replace /path/to/organize_downloads.py with the actual path to your script file.
Windows (using Task Scheduler)

    Open the Task Scheduler: you can search for it in the Start menu or type taskschd.msc in the Run dialog box (Windows key + R).
    Create a new task:
        Click on "Create Basic Task" in the right-hand Actions panel.
        Give the task a name and description, and set the trigger to "Daily" with a start time of 12:00 AM (or any other time you prefer).
        Set the action to "Start a program" and specify the Python executable (usually C:\Python3x\python.exe) and the script file (organize_downloads.py).
        Click "OK" to save the task.

Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while running the script, please check the following:

    Make sure you have replaced the downloads folder path with the correct path.
    Ensure that the script has the necessary permissions to read and write to the downloads folder.
    If you have a large number of files, the script may take some time to complete. Be patient!
